I recently had the honor of giving a talk with [Adam Glynn](http://scholar.harvard.edu/aglynn/) at [The Future of Big Data Symposium](http://bigdata.unl.edu/news-events#agenda) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The talk, entitled "Challenges of Big Data in the Social Sciences", can be viewed here:

In the talk, we presented results from two papers (in addition to broader reflections on big data in the social sciences):

* A [paper](assets/research/fddid.pdf) with [Adam Glynn](http://scholar.harvard.edu/aglynn/) estimating the effect of early voting on turnout in Florida using front-door difference-in-differences techniques;
* A working paper with [Alexander Hertel-Fernandez](http://www.hertelfernandez.com/) using text analysis to examine the success of the American Legislative Exchange Council in introducing and enacting model legislation across the American states.
