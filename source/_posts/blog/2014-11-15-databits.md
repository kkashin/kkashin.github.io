I am a big fan of interactive data visualization for data exploration and presenting research findings, and thus I wanted to share a new site [Sergiy Nesterko](http://nesterko.com/) recently launched called [Databits](http://databits.io/). The site features interactive visualizations built using a variety of tools (primarily D3.js, although there are a few recently examples in Processing.js), and the goal is to get a community of people interested in data visualization to showcase their work (including open-source code), interact with one another, and hopefully hone their skills in the process! It's very much in its initial stages, but please join and contribute if you have visualizations you want to share.

I've uploaded a few of my visualizations [here](http://databits.io/kkashin) and hope to upload more in the near future. One of the nice features of Databits is the ease with which you can embed a visualization in another website.
