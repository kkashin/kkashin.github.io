For most of my time at Facebook, I have been working on tools for adaptive experimentation, the machine-learning guided process of iteratively exploring a (possibly infinite) parameter space in order to identify optimal configurations in a resource-efficient manner. This work has culminated in the development of Ax -- an accessible, general-purpose platform for understanding, managing, deploying, and automating adaptive experiments.

I am really proud to announce that Ax is available as an open-source library. You can check out the tool at [ax.dev](https://ax.dev) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/Ax).

Ax is accompanied by a sister library for Bayesian Optimization built on PyTorch, [BoTorch](https://botorch.org/).

I presented an overview of Ax and BoTorch at F8, Facebook's Developer Conference. See the presentation [here](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/product-optimization-with-adaptive-experimentation/).

You can also [read more about Ax and BoTorch on Facebook AI Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/open-sourcing-ax-and-botorch-new-ai-tools-for-adaptive-experimentation/).
