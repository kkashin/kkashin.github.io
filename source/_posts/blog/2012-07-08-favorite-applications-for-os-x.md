I've recently upgraded to the mid-2012 version of the MacBook Pro, which has given me a chance to completely install all my programs from scratch, as well as re-evaluate the applications I use. After significant research, here are the the applications that I have found extremely useful for Mac OS X, by category:  

<br/>

### Productivity and Organization Tools:

* [Evernote](http://evernote.com/): great note-taking and web clipping utility that synchs with the web and across devices (including iPhone). Also check out [Evernote Trunk](http://evernote.com/trunk/) for many additional, productivity-enhancing add-ons.
* [Papers2](http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/): pdf organization program (costs ~$50 with student discount)
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword): password manager (costs $50)
* [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/): Mac OS X FTP client

### Text Editors:

* [Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/): An editor for text, HTML, LaTeX, C++, Java, Python, R, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and other languages (I use this mostly for LaTeX and Python). Based on GNU Emacs platform. 
* [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/): professional HTML and text editor (and for other languages).

### Graphics:

* [Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/About.html): open source image editor for Mac. It is simpler to use than GIMP because it seeks to provide basic image editing needs, not to replace professional image editing products.
* [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/): GNU Image Manipulation Program that is great open-source replacement for Photoshop. Useful for photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.

Note: Gimp requires X11, an application that implements the X Window System. However, Apple no longer provides X11 support for Mountain Lion directly (as X11.app). However, one can download [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki), which is an open source version of X11 that runs on Mountain Lion and allows to run all X11-based applications in Mac OS X.

### PDF Reader:

* [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/): PDF reader and note-taker. Integrates with Timestamper for Mac application developed for   recording timing of pdf (Beamer) slides during a lecture.

### Music and Videos:

* [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/us/): stream music for free.
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/index.html): open source and cross-platform multimedia player.

### Security:

* [ClamXav](http://www.clamxav.com/): free virus checker for Mac OS X. Based upon open source ClamAV engine.

### Developer Tools:

* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): Apple's developer environment. Includes [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/), the GNU Compiler Collection. I recommend using the Command Line Tools for XCode, which can be installed from within XCode using the "Downloads" pane within "Preferences". Command Line Tools provide UNIX-style development via Terminal by installing command line developer tools (as well as MAC OS X SDK frameworks). Note that these can be installed without installing XCode [here](http://developer.apple.com/downloads).
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/): command line package manager for Mac OS X.
