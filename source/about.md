I'm the Engineering Manager for the Adaptive Experimentation group within Facebook's Core Data Science team. I joined Facebook as a Data Scientist in September 2015.

I was born in Moscow, Russia and grew up dividing my time between the United States and Russia. I holds an A.M. in Political Science (2012), an A.M. in Statistics (2013), and a Ph.D. in Political Science (2015) from Harvard University. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and International Relations from Brown University, from where I graduated magna cum laude in 2010.

I was formerly a Fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. I am the recipient of the Sciences Po-Harvard University Exchange Fellowship and was a Visiting Doctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in Market Societies (MaxPo) in Paris, France for the 2013-2014 academic year. I am also the recipient of the 2013 Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology (with Adam Glynn).
